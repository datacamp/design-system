# Messaging & Positioning Framework

This document outlines the **messaging and positioning framework for DataCamp**. An MPF is an **internal-only document** that’s used by Marketing and other teams to inspire their work. It will become **part of our Design System** and will influence the tone of voice and language guidelines it contains. That said, these aren’t necessarily the exact words that we’ll use to describe DataCamp on the website (i.e., don’t think of this as copy). But it will inspire them. It’s a bit like the source of the Nile for Marketing.

The flow begins with the external context we’re responding to, sets the northstar we’re working toward, then states the initial positioning statement that describes what we do as we head toward the northstar, and concludes with the messaging pillars that make the positioning statement true.

### Context
_Frames our messaging and positioning. External drivers that we’re attaching to._
* Massive skill gap
* Arms race for data science and analytics talent
* Abundance of data, most of it not analyzed, or not analyzed efficiently
* Better decision making dependent on asking better questions (to get better answers)
* Future of work that requires continuous learning

### North Star
_Aspirational target for our brand over the next 18-36 months._
* **Data fluency**
	* Data fluency includes a spectrum of skills and proficiencies. Data fluency means being able to complete most of the tasks you need to accomplish using data skills, or know how/what is needed to acquire those skills.
		* Ex: Novice to expert scale.
	* We want companies to believe that DataCamp is the platform people use to become data fluent—to learn (data skills), practice and apply them, and ultimately to use them to solve problems.
	* Companies are data fluent when: Data science_analytics_skills are embedded across all work functions; so they’re automatic, normalized, and part of the fabric of doing your job.

### Positioning Statement
_What we do, what differentiates us (at a high-level)._
* Where you go to build data science and analytics skills at every stage of your career.
_or_
* The platform for building data science and analytics skills at every stage of your career.

### Brand/Messaging Pillars (4 pillars we recommend)
_The things that make the positioning statement true._
1. **Modern learning experience:** An intuitive, personalized and hands-on approach to online learning paired with expert instruction. DataCamp makes it easy to learn 21st-century skills—from basic data analytics to advanced data science and data engineering—and gain the confidence to apply those skills in the real world right away.
	1. We learn best by doing (LPA), not passive or traditional approach: self-paced, active, hands-on learning by doing with coding in the browser.
	2. Quality courses.
		1. Highly engaging (because of approach; above) and personalized.
		2. Thoughtful, real-time feedback based on the output of the code you write.
		3. Courses built by expert instructors_innovators_experts in the field.
	3. Breadth and depth of the curriculum.
2. **Continuous learning resource**: Designed with the full scope of your career in mind. DataCamp is constantly expanding its curriculum to keep pace with the skills you need today, tomorrow and beyond. DataCamp is an affordable and on-demand learning resource, available anywhere with an internet connection when you need it.
	1. Use it throughout your career when you need it to reinforce existing skills, add new skills, or to build the skills you need to change careers.
		1. New learning content added every week.
		2. Learning when you need it.
	2. Flexible and accessible; ease of use, anytime anywhere learning, affordable. It’s orders of magnitude less expensive than bootcamps (and DataCamp isn’t a one-and-done bootcamp or degree).
	3. Created by a network of innovators/thought leaders.
	4. Access to a community of fellow data science and analytics learners.
3. **Faster path from data to insights:** Learn how to ask better questions to get better insights from your data. The insights we gain from our data not only make us better storytellers, but ultimately better decision makers.
	1. When we know how to ask better questions, we get better answers and insights, which enable better decisions.
		1. Build (and live) an evidence-based, data-driven culture.
		2. Build a better relationship with your data. Ongoing conversation with your data. To make every kind of decision, big or small, to run a business.

		1. Be the difference, show up differently at work.
	3. When everyone is speaking a shared language around data, it’s easier to collaborate. Which makes it easier to use data and insights to do your job more effectively.
4. **Learning at scale:** Distribute data skills across teams, functional areas or an entire organization with an online learning platform that’s easy to implement and manage.
	1. Close the skill gap by building data fluency across your organization.

5. **Skill Assessment:** Gain valuable insights into your data science and analytics skills to get clarity on your current level of understanding, track progress, verify your abilities and understand how your skills align to real-world applications. With personalized recommendations for areas of improvement and what courses and projects to take next, you’ll know exactly what you need to do to achieve your goals.
	1. No more guessing—receive a score that you can be confident in and share to verify your abilities.
