# Grammar & Punctuation
## American English
DataCamp is headquartered in the U.S. and the U.S. contains our largest concentration of users. All DataCamp copy should be written using American English. A summary of spelling differences between American and British English can be found  [here](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/british-and-spelling) .
* Correct: This standardizes the modeling of colors.
* Incorrect: This standardises the modelling of colours.

Using American English also means using American punctuation rules.
* Commas, periods, and exclamation marks should be placed inside of quotation marks when applicable. Ex: “I love DataCamp,” said Michael.
* Include a comma after the following abbreviations: i.e., e.g.,
* Include a period after the following abbreviations: Ms., Mrs., Mr.

## Ampersands
In general, ampersands should not be used in DataCamp copy, and should never be used in a complete sentence. Ampersands should be used very sparingly, only in copy that does not end in a punctuation mark and when space is at an absolute premium. Examples include: Graph labels, email subject lines, social media posts.
* Incorrect: DataCamp has courses in R & Python.

## Capitalization
Only proper nouns (the name of a person, place, or organization) and the first word in a sentence should be capitalized. Noteworthy terminology, such as “data science” or “machine learning,” should not be capitalized unless they are part of a title or headline. These guidelines should be followed in ad copy as well.

For more specific guidelines on the capitalization of DataCamp product features, see [DataCamp and Common Data Science Terminology](Common Data Science) in this guide.

Also see [Titles, headlines, subtitles](#59-titles-headlines-subtitles).

## Comma usage
The Oxford comma (see examples below) should continue to be used in most body copy, such as course descriptions, the main text of blog posts and emails, and long-form articles. Because we are frequently writing about complex topics, the Oxford comma can be helpful to clarify the meaning of sentences.

However, there are exceptions for Marketing and Product teams in particular. Please see detailed explanations and examples below.

### When to use the Oxford comma: Body copy
The Oxford comma places a comma between the word “and” or “or” and the last item in a list. A single item in a list may also contain the word “and” or “or.” Separate items in the list are underlined for example purposes only.
* Ex: DataCamp has courses in _R_, _Python_, _SQL_, and _spreadsheets_.
* Ex: I love learning about _data science and analytics_, _machine learning_, and _artificial intelligence_.

### When you should not use the Oxford comma: Short-form marketing and product copy
The Oxford comma should _not_ be used in copy that does not form a complete sentence. Additionally, the Oxford comma should not be used when space is at a premium (such as social media posts) and the sentence’s meaning is already clear. Do not use the Oxford comma in: headlines, article or website page subheads, email subject lines, social media posts, onboarding instructions in the product, text on buttons in the product.
* Subject line example: New courses in R, Python and spreadsheets

## Dates and times
### Dates
When a month is used with a specific date, abbreviate Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec. Spell out March, April, May, June and July. Do not include a “th” or “rd” at the end of dates (e.g. 3rd, 15th).
* Ex: The webinar is on Jan. 30.
* Exception: Where space and character limits are at a premium, particularly in the product and on social media, do not include a period after the abbreviation for the month.

When a phrase lists only a month and year, spell out the month and do not separate the month and the year with commas.
* Ex: The product will launch in November 2019.

When a phrase refers to a month, day and year, set off the year with commas.
* Ex: The next RStudio conference is on January 12, 2019, in Austin.

### Spacing
There should only be one space following punctuation marks and between sentences.

### Times
Indicate AM and PM with all-caps, no periods, and a space between the number and the AM or PM. For even hours, do not add zeros.
* Ex: 8 AM
* Ex: 3:15 PM

### Time zones
Time zones should also be in all-caps, with no periods.
* Ex: 8 AM EST
* Ex: 3:15 PM CET

### Em dash (aka long dash)
Always use the em dash, or long dash, for punctuation. Note: This should not be confused with hyphens, which are still appropriate for hyphenated terms and compound modifiers (e.g. high-rise, 21st-century skills). There should not be any spaces on either side of the em dash.

**Shortcut for an em dash on a Mac:** Shift + Option + Dash
**Shortcut for an em dash on Windows:** Ctrl + Alt + Dash

* Correct: Our instructors—who can make more than $150,000 per year from DataCamp courses—are experts in their fields.
* Incorrect: Our instructors — who can make more than $150,000 per year from DataCamp courses — are experts in their fields.
* Incorrect: Our instructors — who can make more than $150,000 per year from DataCamp courses — are experts in their fields.
* Incorrect: Our instructors - who can make more than $150,000 per year from DataCamp courses - are experts in their fields.

### Hyperlinks
When including a hyperlink in body copy, do not include “https:” or “www.” This ensures cleaner copy that is easier to read and takes up less space.
* Correct: Visit us at  [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/) .
* Incorrect: Visit us at  [https://www.datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/) .
* Incorrect: Visit us at  [www.datacamp.com](http://www.datacamp.com/) .

### Hyphens
Use hyphens to link all the words in a compound adjective. Do not use a hyphen if the construction includes very or an adverb ending in -ly.
* Correct: Our company makes data-driven decisions.
* Correct: The project had quickly diminishing returns.

### Numbers
In general, spell out numbers one through nine, and use figures for numbers 10 and higher.
* Example: It takes about four hours to complete a course. It may take more than 80 hours to complete a track.

Common exceptions to the rule above include:
* Cents: 8 cents
* Dollars: $3
* Dates: March 4
* Dimensions: 5 foot 2 inches (1.6m)
	* Always include a conversion to meters for an international audience
* Millions, billions: 6 billion people
	* Spell out million, billion, etc., unless space will not allow it. In that case, use a single capital letter to indicate the amount. Example: $7M
* Percentages: 2%
* Speed
	* Always include a conversion to kilometers for an international audience
	* Correct: 10 mph (16 km/h)
* Temperatures
	* Always include a conversion to celsius for an international audience
	* Correct: 5 degrees F (-15 degrees C)
	* Correct: 5 F (-15 C)
* Times: 4 PM

Spell out numbers used at the beginning of a sentence. Exception: Never spell out years.
* Ex: Ten thousand people marched on the capital.
* Ex: 1999 was a bad year for technology companies.

Use commas to set off each group of three digits in numerals higher than 999 (except for years and addresses).
* Ex: 12,650

Use decimals (up to two places) for amounts in the millions and billions that do not require a precise figure.
* Ex: $3.74 billion

Add an “s” but no apostrophe to a number to make it plural. The same rule applies to decades. Use an apostrophe on a decade only if cutting off the initial figures.
* Ex: She kept rolling 7s; the 1980s; the ‘80s

Use hyphens for phone numbers.
* Ex: 555-555-5555

### Titles, headlines, subtitles
* Capitalize the first letter of all words in a title, headline, or subtitle except “stop words,” such as articles and prepositions; this can also be referred to as title case. Examples of stop words in English include: a, all, and, for, each, how, in, with.  [Click here for a list of stop words.](https://kb.yoast.com/kb/list-stop-words/)

### Versus, vs.
Always use the full word “versus” in body copy, such as in a full sentence.
* Ex: If it’s DataCamp versus Pluralsight, DataCamp is a much better choice.

Always use the lowercase abbreviation “vs.” in titles and subtitles.
* Ex: TensorFlow vs. Keras for Deep Learning

## DataCamp & Common Data Science Terminology
### Account
Each of our business customers are referred to internally as an account. Individuals and companies who pay for access have a subscription to DataCamp. Individuals who have a free account are registered users.

### Administrators
Unless space will not allow you to spell it out fully, always use “administrator” instead of the word “admin” when referring to administrators of business subscriptions in DataCamp materials.

### B2C, B2B
The terms B2C and B2B should only be used internally.

### Admin
Always use “admin” instead of “administrator” when referring to administrators of business subscriptions.

When describing different levels of access for admins, do not use the terms “billable” or “non-billable” externally; these designations should only ever be used internally.

To describe admins who only have access to the dashboard, and not DataCamp learning content, you can use the terms “dashboard-only admin” or “admin-only access.”


### Coding languages
Follow the style of the original name of the language. Correct style of DataCamp-supported languages are below:
* Bash
* Git
* Python
* R
* Shell
* Apache Spark
* spreadsheets (only capitalize at the beginning of a sentence, or in a title/course name)
* SQL
	* PostgreSQL
* Scala

### Coding packages and libraries
Follow the style of the original name of the package, including original capitalization style. Even at the beginning of a sentence, packages should not be capitalized unless the package name is capitalized. Correct style of a selection of packages are below:
* astsa
* Bokeh
* broom
* data.table
* dplyr
* ggmap
* ggplot2
* ggvis
* H2O
* highcharter
* Keras
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* pandas
* plotly
* polyglot
* purrr
* PySpark
* R Markdown
* raster
* scikit-learn
* SciPy
* seaborn
* sf
* Shiny
* spaCy
* sparklyr
* stringr
* tidyr
* xts
* zoo

### Courses, practice, projects
In general, do not capitalize “courses,” “practice,” or “projects” in a sentence; always capitalize them in a title or headline.
* Courses: Do not capitalize in a sentence.
	* Exercises within a course should be referred to as “practice exercises.”
* Projects: Do not capitalize in a sentence. You do not need to add “DataCamp” in front of “projects.”
* Practice: Do not capitalize in a sentence. Always refer to practice as “coding challenges,” or a “set of coding challenges” when referring to a practice pool.
	* Incorrect: Practice pools, modes, modules, sessions, exercises.

### Course names
Please refer to Course Naming Guidelines.

### DataCamp
Our company name should always be written as one word, with the “D” and “C” capitalized.
* Correct: DataCamp
* Incorrect: Data Camp
* Incorrect: Datacamp

### DataFrames, data.frame, data frames
When using one of these terms, follow the appropriate usage based on the context of coding language.
* In the context of Python: DataFrame, DataFrames
* In the context of R: data.frame, data frames

### Dataset
Always use “dataset” as one word.
* Correct: The course uses a large dataset.
* Incorrect: The course uses a large data set.

### Fluency (as in data fluency)
Always use the phrase “data fluency,” not “data literacy.”
* Background on this terminology: Literacy is a more binary term (you are either literate or you’re not), while fluency is on a spectrum of proficiency. Fluency also has an aspirational quality, in that you’re always trying to become more fluent in subjects you care about. The word literacy may also have negative connotations, such as being illiterate or implying that you’re unintelligent if you are not data literate.

### Hands-on
Always hyphenate in a sentence.
* Correct: DataCamp has hands-on courses.
* Incorrect: DataCamp has handson courses.
* Incorrect: DataCamp has hands on courses.
* Incorrect: DataCamp courses have hands-on-keyboard exercises.

### Instructors
_Currently recommendations, not strict rules:_
Always use the word “instructor” (not “teacher”) in copy that refers to individuals who have created a premium course or project featured on datacamp.com, including DataCamp employees. The following terms may also be used internally or when communicating directly to DataCamp content creators:
* Community author: Any individual who creates non-premium content that is not featured on datacamp.com. Examples of this type of content include: tutorials; courses created for classroom settings or corporate training using the Teach App, but that are not on datacamp.com or the DataCamp Community. Should not be used in marketing materials.
* Author: Sometimes used generically to refer to any individual who has created any kind of content using DataCamp. This more generic term may be helpful when we are referring to something that affects all authors, such as announcing an update to the Teach Editor. Should not be used in marketing materials.

### Joins
Never use a hyphen for the following: self joins, semi joins, anti joins, cross joins, inner joins, outer joins.
* Incorrect: self-join

### Licenses
Always use the term “licenses” in reference to licenses purchased for DataCamp for Business members. Never use the term “seats” in this context.


### Spreadsheets
Capitalize when used in a title or course name, but do not capitalize when used in a sentence. The singular or plural form can be used; the choice should be determined based on readability.
* Ex: Python for Spreadsheet Users
* Ex: Pivot Tables in Spreadsheets
* Ex: DataCamp has Python, R, and spreadsheet courses.
* Ex: DataCamp has courses in Python, R, and spreadsheets.

### Teach, Teach Editor
_Currently recommendations, not strict rules:_
The terms Teach, Teach App, and Teach Editor should only be used internally and in direct communication instructors. More descriptive terms may also be used (see below).
* Teach: Refers to all authoring tools for content creators.
	* Can also be referred to as “authoring tools.”
* Teach App: Refers to the Teach dashboard.
	* Can also be referred to as “the Teach dashboard.”
* Teach Editor: Refers to the content editor.
	* Can also be referred to as the “content editor.” Should not be referred to as the “course editor,” which excludes projects, practice and tutorials; and should not be referred to as “the editor,” which is too general.

### Tidyverse
When talking about the package, never capitalize it. If you're talking about it more generally, capitalize only at the start of sentences.

### Users
Users should be referred to as learners. In the context of enterprise customers, learners may be referred to as employees or team members in sales and marketing materials.

### XP
When referring to XP, always use capital letters and use a space between XP and the number.
* Ex: I have 4,700 XP.

### Correct spelling of general technology terms
* e-book
* email
* cellphone
* Facebook
* Google
* Hashtag
* internet
* iPad, iPhone, etc.
* LinkedIn
* social media
* Twitter, tweet, tweeted, retweet
* website
* YouTube

## Course Naming Guidelines
### General guidelines for all course names
* Descriptive
	* Course names should describe the core topic of the course. They should be intuitive for the intended audience and use real words (not made up). Optimize for SEO.
* Distinct
	* Course names should not overlap/conflict with other course names.
* Durable
	* Course names need to endure beyond the current hype cycle (i.e. not just a trending term).
* Length
	* Limit course names to 40 characters for course names (paid ads cut off text past that limit). The shorter the better for SEO (noting that “with pandas” or “in Python” helps SEO).

### Abbreviations
Commonly used abbreviations are okay to use (e.g. IDE). When in doubt, spell out terms in the course description.
* Spell out “Introduction”; do not use “Intro.”

### Capitalization
Course names and chapter titles should be written in title case: Capitalize the first letter of all words in a course name and chapter title except “stop words,” such as articles and prepositions. Examples of stop words in English include: a, all, and, for, each, how, in, with.  [Click here for a list of stop words.](https://kb.yoast.com/kb/list-stop-words/)

Exercise names and slide titles should be written in sentence case: Only capitalize the first word of the exercise name or title and any proper nouns.

### Coding languages, packages and libraries
See [Coding languages and Coding packages and libraries](#technologies-coding-languages-and-packages).

### DataFrames, data.frame, data frames
See [DataFrames, data.frame, data frames](#dataframes-dataframe-data-frames).

### Dataset
See [Dataset](#dataset).

###  Domains
_Currently a recommendation, not a strict rule:_
Only include the domain (e.g. HR, marketing) in a course name when necessary for clarity. Prioritize outcomes and learning objectives over domains.

For example, “HR Analytics in Python: Predicting Employee Churn” does not need to include “HR.” The domain is clearly understood based on the rest of the course name.

Alternatively, “Marketing Analytics in R: Choice Modeling” benefits from including the domain “marketing” for learners who are not familiar with choice modeling.

### Proficiency levels
Use consistent terminology when referring to proficiency levels.
* For introductory courses, use the following construction: “Introduction to [course topic]”
* Do not use alternative words such as “foundation(s),” “fundamentals,” or “basics.”
	* Correct: Introduction to Inference, Introduction to Spreadsheets
	* Incorrect: Foundations of Inference, Big Data Fundamentals

### Punctuation
* Do not use Oxford commas in course names.
* Do not use ampersands in course names.

### Technologies, coding languages and packages
* Course names should reflect the following construction: “with” a package, “in” a technology.
	* Ex: With pandas in Python
	* Ex: With ggplot2 in R
* For consistency, lean in favor of course names ending with “in [language]” or “with [package].”
	* Ex: “Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL” is preferred over “SQL for Exploratory Data Analysis.”
