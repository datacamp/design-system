## Regular Logo

Our full, standard logo includes both the logomark (DC) and the wordmark (DataCamp). Unless you specifically need a square logo format, please use one of the four regular logos below.

<LogoPreview title="Regular" fileName="logo-regular">

This is the preferred logo to use on a light background. When in doubt, this is usually the best logo to use.

</LogoPreview>

<LogoPreview title="Regular Monochrome" fileName="logo-regular-monochrome">

If the green logomark (DC) doesn't contrast enough with the background or if you have been given specs that specifically call for a black logo, use the Regular Monochrome logo on a light background. This logo should only be used when absolutely necessary.

</LogoPreview>

<LogoPreview title="Regular Inverted" fileName="logo-regular-inverted" isInverted>

This is the preferred logo to use on a dark background.

</LogoPreview>

<LogoPreview title="Regular Inverted Monochrome" fileName="logo-regular-inverted-monochrome" isInverted>

If the green logomark (DC) doesn't contrast enough with the background or if you have been given specs that specifically call for a white logo, use the Regular Monochrome Inverted logo on a dark background. This logo should only be used when absolutely necessary.

## Favicon

All DataCamp sites and applications should use the logomark (DC) as a favicon. The necessary collection of files and the _code_ which should be placed in the HTML `head` element can be downloaded below.
