## Overview

A component to render tooltip using the styles of this design system. Please note that this component is designed to be used as a building block for other components, and as such should only be accessed directly when using with non-waffles components. For example when using a `Button`, the tooltip is accessible through the [button props API](/components/button#props). Before using this component it would be best to reach out to the squad as it is only designed for specific uses.
