## Overview

The `@datacamp/waffles-tokens` package exposes all the primitive values necessary to style apps according to [design guidelines](https://www.figma.com/file/Flh00IKR70ff0bRvFW2Iou/%5BDC%5D-Design-Guidelines-Exploration?node-id=376%3A1144). These values can be accessed and used using a variety of tools, including CSS-in-JS libraries such as emotion.

### Usage

To use any of the styles, simply import the `@datacamp/waffles-tokens` package and directly access the necessary properties. For example if the green color is needed then it should be accessed as follows.

```
import tokens from '@datacamp/waffles-tokens';

const greenColor = tokens.colors.green;
```

This hex code can then be used wherever is necessary. All the tokens can be accessed and used in the same way.

### Colors

For each of the primary colours, there are 3 variations. The standard color e.g. `green` should be used as a priority, but there is also a dark and a light version of every colour. There is also a version to use as a text color when being used against a light coloured background, e.g. `greenDarkText`. For some colors this is the same as one of the other variants, but it will always have sufficient contrast against one of the lighter backgrounds. When working against a dark background, the standard colours are appropriate.
