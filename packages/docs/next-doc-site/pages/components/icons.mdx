## Overview

A package contains all the icons available within Waffles.

The main export of the package is a set of React components. These can be individually be imported:

```
import { AddCircleIcon } from '@datacamp/waffles-icons';
```

All these components accept the same set of properties:

- **size** – The size of an icon. The default is `medium`. Possible values: `medium`, `small`, and `xsmall`.
- **color** – The color of the icon. This defaults to _currentColor_, and so will match the surrounding text. If a custom color is required, then this prop can accept any valid CSS color. We recommend using the [waffles-tokens](/components/tokens) to maintain a consistent visual experience.
- **className** – Any extra className to pass to the root svg element. Can be used to apply any extra custom styling required.

For screen readers to be able to present the icons they all include a default `title`, however this should be overriden using the title prop if the icon is serving a specific purpose. If the icon is being used purely for decoration, and related text is sufficient, set the `aria-hidden` prop to `true`. This will prevent screen readers from announcing its presence.

## React Native

There are also react-native versions of all these icons. These can be used the same way as on web, the only difference being that instead of `className`, the `style` prop can be used to add custom styling. These components can be imported in the same way. When in a `react-native` environment, this will resolve to the correct version.

```
import { AddCircleIcon } from '@datacamp/waffles-icons';
```

## Sprites

For those that cannot use react components, there are also svg sprites available in the waffles-icons package. There are five different formats available at the file paths listed below. Check the [detailed overview of the differences between these different sprites](https://github.com/svg-sprite/svg-sprite/blob/HEAD/docs/configuration.md#output-modes). Feel free to use whichever makes most sense for your use case.
