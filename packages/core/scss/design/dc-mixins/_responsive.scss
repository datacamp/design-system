/**
 * Retina media query mixin
 *
 * This media query is meant to scope only high resolution screens,
 * commonly referred to as "retina" screens.
 * Whenever you set an image as a background-image in CSS, you'll also
 * need to specify a high res (retina) version of that background image.
 * This mixin will help you do that without having to remember and
 * repeating these crazy rules.
 *
 *
 * Example use case:
 * .my-selector {
 *   background: url('path/to/asset.jpg') no-repeat;
 *
 *   @include retina {
 *     background-image: url('path/to/asset@2x.jpg');
 *     background-size: #px #px;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Note on the example above:
 * Notice that we only override the background-image property and most
 * importantly, set the size of the image to the 1x asset dimensions
 * through the background-size property.
 * The 2x asset will in reality be double the 1x asset size in pixels.
 *
